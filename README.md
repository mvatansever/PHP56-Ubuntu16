# PHP56-Ubuntu16
Ubuntu 16.04 with PHP 5.6 version Docker container.

# Why do this container?
Because Ubuntu 16.04 coming with PHP7 default and repository package name must be specify with PHP 5.6 so this container install php5.6 and extensions with this specific version. 
Lastly php cli version changed 7.0 to 5.6 and composer installation start.
